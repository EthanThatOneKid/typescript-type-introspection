# typescript-type-introspection

Reason with TypeScript code via
[type introspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_introspection).

TODO: Figure out what else to do next with this such as merging the PR that is
currently open, at least.

## Installation

```sh
# TODO: Publish on JSR.io
```

## TypeBox

> TypeBox objects are JSON Schema objects with extra in-memory magic!
>
> A fun way to think about TypeBox is that it does for JSON Schema what drizzle
> does for SQL - itâ€™s a nice, TypeScript-friendly builder syntax for an existing
> spec that tries to expose all of the specâ€™s power. Thatâ€™s not all TypeBox is -
> it has an extremely fast built-in type checker, it can create example values
> based on schemas, and a lot more.
