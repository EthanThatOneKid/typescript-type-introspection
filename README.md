# typescript-type-introspection

Reason with TypeScript code via
[type introspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_introspection).

## Introspection

Introspection helps avoid the problem of slow types introduced by libraries like
Zod and TypeBox. It allows you to determine the type of a value at runtime,
rather than inferring it at compile time. This can lead to more efficient and
dynamic type handling in your TypeScript projects.

## Installation

```sh
# TODO: Publish on JSR.io
```

## TypeBox

> TypeBox objects are JSON Schema objects with extra in-memory magic!
>
> A fun way to think about TypeBox is that it does for JSON Schema what drizzle
> does for SQL - itâ€™s a nice, TypeScript-friendly builder syntax for an existing
> spec that tries to expose all of the specâ€™s power. Thatâ€™s not all TypeBox is -
> it has an extremely fast built-in type checker, it can create example values
> based on schemas, and a lot more.

### TypeBox example

Instantiate a TypeBox schema at runtime using introspection via
`@sinclair/typebox/compiler`.

```ts
// TODO: Add TypeBox example.
```

## Development

Make sure to install Deno:
<https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation>.

Run the tests:

```sh
deno task dev
```

Format the project:

```sh
deno fmt
```

Check for common errors:

```sh
deno lint
```
